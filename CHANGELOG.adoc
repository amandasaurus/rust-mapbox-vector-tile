== Unreleased

 * Refactor to make compilable on stable release channel. Remove `TryFrom`
   since that's still only availbable on nightly. Call
   `DrawingCommands::try_to_geometry(x)` to convert to geometry.
 * Upgrade `geo` dependency to 0.12.0
 * `Tile` now has getters/etc for layers based on layer name

== v0.3.0

 * Performance improvements from reducing gzip compression
 * Use `Rc<String>` more often to allow users to reduce memory usage

== v0.2.0

 * Actual error handling, instead of panic when invalid geometries are
   encountered
